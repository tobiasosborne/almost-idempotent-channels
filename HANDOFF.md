# HANDOFF.md — almost-idempotent-channels

## ▶▶ LATEST (2026-06-01b, orchestrated, laptop): aic-w4o.1 increment 1 LANDED — certified degenerate-Hermitian eig + rank

**State:** master green, increment 1 committed + pushed. `ctest -L fast` 15/15 (~2.2s);
`test_eigmult` new (`fast`, 0.55s, 21 checks). Session was wound up by user directive AFTER
increment 1 (a clean self-contained stopping point), BEFORE the full Rule-9 hostile review.

**What landed (the certified-arb path's foundational degenerate-eig wall, FINDINGS §D5):**
- `src/aic_mat_eig_multiple.c` (NEW, 151 LOC): `aic_mat_eig_hermitian_multiple` (certified
  eigenvalue balls for a DEGENERATE Hermitian spectrum — the degeneracy-robust counterpart to
  the simple-spectrum `aic_mat_eig_hermitian`) + `aic_mat_certified_rank` (count-above-thr with
  a CERTIFIED gap; `arb_gt`/`arb_lt`, fail-loud straddle).
- `aic_ucp_carrier_rank` (NEW, in `src/aic_ucp_carrier.c`): the certified counterpart to the
  double-path `aic_ucp_carrier_rank_latd` (thr = `dim_K·2^-52·‖Q‖_F` as an arb ball). **Retires
  the most-cited §D5 deferral (carrier dimension is now certified).**
- `tests/test_eigmult.c` (NEW): T1 double-vs-arb (worst ball radius 2.9e-37 @prec=128), T2 η=0
  oracle (projector ranks exact; depolarizing `(1/d)I_{d²}` single cluster), T3 certified-vs-double
  carrier rank, T4/T5 fail-loud teeth under the fork+SIGALRM watchdog. 3 mutations RED→GREEN.

**THE AUDITION RESULT (Law 4, record it):** Route 1 (Rump cluster enclosures via
`acb_mat_approx_eig_qr`→`acb_mat_eig_multiple`) CHOSEN. **Route 2 (eig-free pivoted Cholesky) is a
FLINT-3.x DEAD END** — no `acb_mat_cho`; `arb_mat_cho`/`arb_mat_ldl` are SPD-only (return 0 on the
semidefinite Choi/carrier). Route 3 (inertia) needs the same primitive, no better.

**⚠ KEY LIMITATION (FINDINGS §D5n, guarded fail-loud):** `acb_mat_eig_multiple` is
SEED-CONDITIONING-limited, NOT precision-limited: when TWO clusters EACH have multiplicity ≥2 and
the QR seed gives near-parallel cluster eigenvectors, it returns 0 (fails) EVEN at prec=256. The
routine is sound (never wrong — certifies or fails loud), but the project's `⊕B(L_j)` block
algebras hit exactly this boundary, so increment 2 MUST fix the seed (per-cluster
re-orthonormalise / gap-deflation) before certified Kraus extraction works on all real inputs.

**▶ NEXT = `aic-4td` (P1):** (1) the DEFERRED full Rule-9 hostile review of increment 1; (2)
increment 2 proper — certified invariant-subspace via `acb_mat_eig_enclosure_rump` per cluster →
certified `aic_ucp_choi_to_kraus_arb` + carrier subspace split; (3) the §D5n seed fix. Slow suite
(arb/MOSEK ~8min) NOT re-run this session — increment 1 only ADDS code (no existing path changed),
fast gate + clean build is the evidence; re-run full `ctest` next session to reconfirm.

## ▶▶ NEXT AGENT — START HERE (2026-06-01)

**State:** master is FULLY GREEN — `ctest --test-dir build` (32 fast/slow tests) all pass;
working tree clean; everything committed AND pushed. bd: **43 open (39 ready) / 43 closed.**
The paper's five constructive headlines (`th_idemp_structure`, `th_almost_idemp`, `th_main`,
`th_main_ext`, `th_factorization`) were already done before this session; this session was
infrastructure + correctness + capability beads (see the CHECKPOINT below).

**Mandate (standing user directive — memory `feedback_autonomous_orchestration`):** drive the
WHOLE backlog autonomously and serially; delegate each step to subagents (Opus for code / heavy
design with thinking level by task; Sonnet/Explore for survey/summary); hostile-review every
Core change (Rule 9); mutation-prove the load-bearing teeth; **commit AND push every green
increment** (`bd export > .beads/issues.jsonl` before each commit); **raise a bead for every
issue you surface**; be laptop-compute-aware (iterate on `ctest -L fast`, bound heavy runs, run
MOSEK on SMALL dims — do NOT blanket-defer). Guiding bar: *what would a senior expert C/Julia
engineer demand for best practice/quality?* Escalate only on a SERIOUS blocker.

> **⚠ META-LESSON FROM THIS SESSION — do NOT repeat:** the previous agent closed 7 beads then
> STOPPED at a "clean checkpoint" while 39 ready beads remained, rationalising it as
> context/compaction risk. That was wrong: atomic commit+push after every bead + a current
> HANDOFF make continuing safe (compaction at worst loses one *uncommitted* in-flight bead). The
> user explicitly wanted continuous work. **Keep going until the backlog is genuinely exhausted
> or you hit a real blocker — a checkpoint is not a stopping point.**

**First commands:**
```
bd ready ; bd show <id>                          # 39 ready
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
ctest --test-dir build -L fast                   # ~1s, 14 tests — the iteration gate
ctest --test-dir build                           # full (slow set arb-heavy, ~7-8 min at -j3)
```
Build/layout: `make` is now a thin wrapper over CMake; `src/*.c` and `tests/test_*.c` are
AUTO-GLOBBED (CONFIGURE_DEPENDS) — no CMakeLists edit to add a file. Tests link the STATIC lib
(full symbols, NDEBUG stripped so `assert()` is live). After adding src, `cmake --build build
--target aic` refreshes `libaic.so` so the new symbols export (default visibility).

**Best next picks (laptop-tractable, rough priority):**
1. **`aic-95g.2` (Julia JLL) or `aic-obc` (Julia ccall pkg)** — BOTH now UNBLOCKED by the closed
   CMake bead (`libaic.so` builds; `find_package(AIC)` / `aic.pc` work; Julia 1.12.5 present).
   Caveat on `.2`: AICTargets bakes the absolute libflint path (the JLL builds its own FLINT —
   see the bead note).
2. **`aic-w4o.2` (full acb SVD U,Σ,V)** — the certified ARB path; HARDER, entangles the OPEN
   `aic-w4o.1` degenerate-eig wall (acb SVD via eig of A†A / the Hermitian dilation hits repeated
   singular values). The double-path `aic_latd_svd` exists as the uncertified anchor + cross-check.
3. **Wave-D cleanups / test-teeth (compute-light):** `aic-92i`, `aic-cr6`, `aic-htb`, `aic-kyj`,
   `aic-dka`, `aic-7xx` (umbrella header; couples with `aic-w9f` visibility), `aic-rcm`/`aic-erz`
   (canary-cost cuts).
4. **Heavy-but-smart (bounded):** `aic-bag` (F4.2 dim-canary on n=2-5 + dual reformulation —
   MOSEK 11 + `~/mosek/mosek.lic` ARE on this box), `aic-l5b`, `aic-0at`.

**Reusable assets shipped this session (use, don't reinvent):**
- `include/aic/aic_channels.h` — public channel constructors; the exactly-idempotent ones
  (dephasing / cond_expectation / depolarizing@p=1 / closed-group twirl) are clean η=0 oracles.
- `tests/test_xo0_failloud.c` — the fork+SIGALRM watchdog pattern for testing Rule-4 ABORTS
  without crashing the test binary (`test_channels.c` reuses it for input-validation teeth).
- `aic_ucp_power` / `aic_ucp_compress` (`aic_ucp.h`); `aic_latd_eig_general` / `aic_latd_spectral_gap`
  / `aic_latd_spectral_separation` (`aic_latd.h`).

**Env (filed `aic-kel`):** laptop clock skew → `make` emits benign "Clock skew detected"; Ninja
hard-fails "manifest dirty" → the build uses the default **Make** generator (`rm -rf build` clears
a stuck dir). MOSEK 11 + license present; Julia 1.12.5 (juliaup); Python 3.12 present but `venv`
missing (use `uv` for the Python bead `aic-95g.3`).

## ▶ LATEST CHECKPOINT (2026-06-01, LAPTOP session: CMake migration CLOSED; autonomous backlog orchestration) — READ FIRST

**New working mode (user directive):** drive ALL beads autonomously, serial, delegating
each step to subagents (Opus for code/design, Sonnet/Explore for survey), commit+push every
green increment, laptop-compute-aware (bound heavy/MOSEK work, don't blanket-defer), raise
beads for issues. Memory: `feedback_autonomous_orchestration`.

**`aic-95g.1` (Makefile→CMake migration) is CLOSED** (HEAD `dcfe828`). The C core now builds
with **CMake** (canonical); the `Makefile` is a thin wrapper. **New commands (see `BUILDING.md`):**
`cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build` (or `make`); `ctest --test-dir build -L fast`
(sub-second laptop gate, or `make test-fast`); `ctest --test-dir build` (full, or `make test`);
`cmake --install build --prefix <p>` (set the prefix at CONFIGURE time). Delivered over 5
increments (each committed): headers→`include/aic/`; single-compile OBJECT lib→`libaic.so.0.1.0`
+`libaic.a`; install/export/pkg-config (`find_package(AIC CONFIG)`→`AIC::aic`/`AIC::aic_static`,
`aic.pc`); version single-sourced (`aic 0.1.0`); CTest TIMEOUT+fast/slow labels. Two real
portability traps handled: Debian `flint.pc` OMITS `-lflint` (find_library + Libs.private);
`find_package(LAPACK)` does NOT give LAPACKE (linked explicitly). **Hostile review (Rule 9)
caught a BLOCKER:** `RelWithDebInfo` injects `-DNDEBUG` which stripped all 342 `assert()`
guards (test_smoke passed with `assert(1==2)`); fixed by stripping `-DNDEBUG` from every config,
mutation-proven. Full-suite sign-off: **29/31** (final config, 465s).

**⚠ Two PRE-EXISTING REDS on master's slow suite** (proven by the review to fail IDENTICALLY
under the old Makefile — NOT migration regressions, both filed P2): `test_cstar_build` T2b
`.tex:484` universality canary `m=3 halves-ratio 1.2622 > KAPPA=1.25`; `test_opspace_o2` T2
`committed dual not feasible` (rebuilt J(v*) off by 1.728). These mean the slow suite was
already not green. Other beads filed this session: `aic-w9f` (deferred -fvisibility=hidden +
curated AIC_EXPORT ABI — kept DEFAULT visibility so the ccall surface stays exported for the
JLL; coordinate with umbrella `aic-7xx`), the `test_errreduce` 115s cost, and the laptop
clock-skew (`make` "Clock skew detected" warnings; Ninja "manifest dirty" → use default Make
generator).

**▶ ALSO DONE THIS SESSION (beyond the CMake migration):** `aic-xo0` (fail-loud entry guard on
`aic_assoc_regularize` + the project's FIRST executable fail-loud test — a reusable fork+SIGALRM
watchdog subprocess harness; reframing: the pipeline never actually HUNG, and `make_mixconj`
CANNOT go out-of-regime at any t — FINDINGS §C15), `aic-36j` (regenerated the stale opspace_o2
MOSEK dual fixture — legitimate: the F3 ucp fix changed v's Kraus representation; the bracket +
η=0 oracle safeguards confirm v is sound), `aic-54y` (robustified the th_main `.tex:484`
universality canary to an AND-gate = ratio>1.25 AND slope>0.28 — the m=3 1.2622 was a LONE n=10
geometry outlier, slope 0.08 ≪ 0.36, so **th_main dimension-independence HOLDS**). **BOTH
pre-existing master slow-suite reds are now CLEARED — full `ctest` is 32/32 green.** Also
shipped `aic-7hg` (NEW public physical-channel constructor library — dephasing/depolarizing/
pauli/mix_unitaries/group_twirl/cond_expectation over `aic_ucp_kraus`, exported in libaic,
include/aic/aic_channels.h; hostile-reviewed, which closed a dag-order test-blindness gap via
a non-Hermitian-U cross-check) and `aic-xxk` (`aic_ucp_power` Φ^k + `aic_ucp_compress` —
power compresses each step so the Kraus count stays at the Choi rank, not r^k; 46 invariants,
uses the aic-7hg channels as idempotence oracles). New beads filed: `aic-w9f` (visibility
deferral), `aic-rcm` (test_errreduce 115s cost), the laptop clock-skew bug. Also `aic-pvs`
(`aic_latd_eig_general` zgeev non-Hermitian eig + `aic_latd_spectral_gap`/`_separation` helpers,
validated by the zgeev-vs-zheev Hermitian cross-check). **SEVEN beads closed this session;
master fully green throughout.**

**▶ NEXT (autonomous wave plan, laptop-tractable first):** Wave B — only `aic-w4o.2` (full acb
SVD: U, Σ, V) remains (`aic-7hg`/`aic-xxk`/`aic-pvs` DONE; the new `aic_channel_*` also supply
the diverse/out-of-regime fixtures the codebase lacked) → Wave C consume the package (`aic-obc` Julia ccall now that CMake builds libaic.so,
then `aic-95g.2` JLL / `.3` Python) → Wave D robustness/test-teeth → Wave E heavy-but-smart
(`aic-bag` F4.2 on SMALL dims n=2-5 + dual reformulation) → Wave F research escalations
(`aic-1bc` analytic c0, `aic-3qv` Ω(1)-gap, `aic-ynu` Artin-Wedderburn). Build/test:
`make` or `cmake --build build`; `ctest --test-dir build -L fast` (sub-second gate); full
`ctest --test-dir build` (slow set arb-heavy, ~8 min at -j3).

## ▶ PRIOR CHECKPOINT (2026-05-31, session: HEADLINE CLOSED on F4.1; F4.2 → v0.2; packaging planned) — READ FIRST

**The paper's FINAL headline `th_factorization` (`aic-tff`) is CLOSED.** Delivered on
F4.1: certified `Δ,Υ,B` (genuine C*), η=0 oracle exact (`ΔΥ=Φ`, `ΥΔ=1_B` to ~1e-75),
per-instance rigorous `O(η)` eig-free bound (`hi/η ∈ [3.1,5.9]`), four dual channels
(`Enc=Υ*`, `Dec=Δ*`). `test_factorize` n=121 green, zero warnings. With this, **ALL the
paper's constructive headlines are done**: th_idemp_structure, th_almost_idemp, th_main,
th_main_ext, th_factorization. `master` clean + pushed (HEAD `0f0e75d`).

**F4.2 (the faithful dimension-independence canary) DEFERRED to v0.2 — bead `aic-bag`.**
The Convex.jl diamond-norm DUAL SDP stalls (SLOW_PROGRESS) at n≥6 (n=7 OOMs at 47 GB),
INDEPENDENT of MOSEK tolerance (tight 1e-14 → ~100s/~20GB; relaxed 1e-9 → still stalls),
so the tight two-sided arb certificate is blocked at the sweep dims. The PRIMAL converges
OPTIMAL and IS the faithful cb-norm (e.g. mixconj_blocks(6,2): `‖ΔΥ−Φ‖_cb=0.012955`); the
strong-duality poison guard correctly refused to emit a loose-dual fixture (no fake).
FINDINGS §D6. Scaffolding committed: `src/aic_factorize_shim.{c,h}` (green, smoke-tested),
`tools/gen_fixtures_factorize_f4.jl` (eager-flush + `F4_ONLY` filter + relaxed-tol override
+ GC). v0.2 routes in `aic-bag`: reformulate the dual / move to direct JuMP+MOSEK /
primal-only canary.

**Packaging PLANNED (NEW epic `aic-95g`).** Three web-researched docs
(`docs/research/packaging_{c_core,julia,python_and_release}.md`) + 4 children: `.1` CMake
migration (the READY linchpin — also fixes the slow/hang-prone `make test` via CTest),
`.2` Julia JLL (Yggdrasil; the OpenBLAS32-not-OpenBLAS gotcha), `.3` Python cffi+wheels,
`.4` release engineering. Crux across all three: the FLINT/arb+LAPACK native dep.

**▶ NEXT AGENT — two independent ready fronts:**
1. **Packaging** (`aic-95g.1`, the CMake migration) — self-contained, low-risk, high-value
   (unblocks Julia+Python distribution AND fixes the test-speed/hang pain). Likely first.
2. **v0.2 F4.2 rigorous cert** (`aic-bag`) — the diamond-norm dual at n≥6.

## ▶ PRIOR CHECKPOINT (2026-05-31, session: factorize F4.1 + F3-fix landed; hostile review INTERRUPTED)

Orchestrated session. **Net: factorize F4.1 (end-to-end verify + dual channels)
and a root-cause F3 robustness fix (PSD-cone Kraus extraction) are BUILT, green,
and COMMITTED — but the mandatory Core-tier hostile review was INTERRUPTED by a
session crash and has NOT signed off.** `test_factorize` n=121 (was 70),
no-regression green (`test_ucp` 373, `test_idemp` 76, `test_opspace_choi` 41),
zero warnings. F4.2 (the MOSEK dim-independence canary) is the only increment left.

### What landed (committed this session; hostile review still PENDING)
- **F4.1** — `src/aic_factorize_verify.c` (`J_DelUps = Choi(ΔΥ)−Choi(Φ)` N²×N²;
  `J_UpsDel = Choi(ΥΔ−P_B)` n_B²×n_B²; eig-free per-instance `O(η)` bounds) +
  `src/aic_factorize_dual.c` (`Dec=Δ*`, `Enc=Υ*` Kraus read-off). T7 η=0 oracle
  (`‖J‖_F~1e-75`, exact), T8 η>0 eig-free (single + MULTI-block; `hi/η∈[3.1,5.9]`),
  the §D route-(i)-vs-(ii) probe (`offblk=0`, routes agree). `.tex:2730-2739,2159`.
- **F3-fix** (FINDINGS §C14) — the paper's `Δ′` is only `O(η)`-CP: its manifest-CP
  form (`.tex:2791-2796`) is exact only if `Δ̃` is an EXACT hom, but `v` is only an
  `O(η)`-iso, so the multi-block η>0 UCP-`Δ` per-block Choi has an `O(η²)` negative
  eig that tripped the strict Kraus PSD gate. Fix: `aic_ucp_choi_to_kraus_latd_tol`
  (PSD-cone clip + certified mass guard + fail-loud on genuine non-CP); the strict
  `aic_ucp_choi_to_kraus_latd` delegates to it unchanged. Clipped mass ~`0.01·η²`
  (measured), ≪ the `1e-2` ceiling. Repays the §C13(c) m≥2∧η>0 coverage debt AND
  unblocks F4.2's canary. Also the §A.2 `−1_B`=`P_B` conditional-expectation fix.
- Side work: PR #2 (docs frictions report) merged with an F5/W5 correction;
  wishlist filed as beads `aic-l5b`(W2,P1)/`xxk`/`7hg`/`pvs`/`7xx`/`dka`/`e57`/`tk7`.

### ▶ NEXT AGENT PICKS UP HERE
1. **COMPLETE the interrupted F4.1+F3-fix hostile review** (Rule 9 — NOT signed
   off). The chief open item — `neg_tol=1e-3` / `ceiling=1e-2` robustness toward
   η→1/4 — is resolved ANALYTICALLY: `minEig ≈ −0.005·η²` ⇒ `|minEig|<3.1e-4<1e-3`
   across all valid `η<1/4` (margin ~3×); the `η≥1/4` region is out-of-hypothesis
   and the build does not run there. Still confirm leaks / Convention-A index order
   / dual direction / probe non-vacuity. Run BOUNDED (per-point `timeout`); do NOT
   sweep `t` past ~0.1 (CLAUDE.md "Probe/sweep hygiene").
2. **F4.2** — `docs/research/factorize_f4_design.md` §C: the shim
   (`src/aic_factorize_shim.c`), `tools/gen_fixtures_factorize_f4.jl` (square
   self-map diamond SDP, POISON guards), committed `tests/fixtures_factorize_f4.inc.h`,
   T9 consumer + the `make_mixconj_blocks` dim-canary. Then `aic-tff` closes.

### Incident (do not repeat — CLAUDE.md "Probe/sweep hygiene", bead aic-xo0)
A throwaway review probe `tests/test_zprobe.c` swept the mixing knob to `t=0.45`
(η past 1/4, outside the `ρ(Φ²−Φ)<1/4` regularization basin) with no per-point
timeout → the pipeline BUILD hung forever → the session crashed and the review's
in-process state was lost. The probe was named `test_*.c`, so the Makefile glob
would also have run it in `make test`. The underlying Rule-4 gap (hang instead of
fail-loud out-of-regime) is bead `aic-xo0`.

## ▶ PRIOR CHECKPOINT (2026-05-31, session: factorize F1–F3 DONE + F4 designed)

Orchestrated session (serial: research/competition → implement (Opus) → independent
build-verify → hostile review (Opus) → fix → commit + push, per increment). **Net:
`factorize` (`th_factorization`, the paper's FINAL headline, bead `aic-tff`) is THREE-
QUARTERS done — the constructive UCP pair `Δ: B→B(H)`, `Υ: B(H)→B` through the genuine
C\* algebra `B` is BUILT, hostile-reviewed, and pushed (F1–F3). F4 (end-to-end
verification + duals + the dim-independence canary) is the only remaining increment and
is fully DESIGNED.** `master` is clean and pushed (HEAD `5f84906` + this checkpoint),
**31/31 test binaries green** (parallel gate, zero warnings), `test_factorize` n=70.

**What this session shipped (each through the full pipeline + a hostile review that
returned SHIP with real mutation-proven teeth):**
- **F1** (`58befe7`) — the NON-UCP `Δ̃ = ι∘v`, `Υ̃ = v⁻¹∘Φ̃` (`.tex:2749-2752`). Exact
  identities `Δ̃Υ̃=Φ̃`, `Υ̃Δ̃=1_B` + the η=0 oracle, all machine-precision. Reuses
  `aic_cstar_build` (v) + `aic_opspace_build_vinv` (v⁻¹) + `aic_assoc` (Φ̃).
- **F2** (`c674599`) — the UCP encode `Δ` via the unitary-1-design CP-ization
  (`.tex:2771-2801`). The payoff MEASURED: `Δ̃` NOT CP (minEig −2.1e-3) → `Δ'` CP
  (+9.4e-6); `‖Δ−Δ̃‖=O(η)`. Per-block Choi PSD via the §C5 midpoint+Weyl gate.
- **F3** (`b6c9865`) — the UCP decode `Υ` via `lem_RC` (`.tex:2840-2899`), the hardest
  increment. η=0 oracle `ΥΔ=1_B`/`ΔΥ=Φ` exact; η>0 `Υ` UCP, `‖Υ−Υ̃‖=O(η)`. Built from
  a **3-way design competition** (Opus deep + Opus adversarial + Sonnet independent →
  `docs/research/factorize_f3_synthesis.md`) that decisively resolved the partial-trace-
  direction bug-class (`partial_trace_left`, verified vs `aic_mat.h`) and the F-ancilla
  ordering (`1_F⊗·`, the D5 pin: F-LEFT 4.4e-2 vs F-RIGHT 7.6e-1 at r>1).
- Design docs (`67f7f9c`): the three F3 specs + the synthesis; **FINDINGS §C13** (the
  F-LEFT `.tex`-deviation [Law 1], the structurally-vacuous ξ_j tooth, and the
  `m≥2 ∧ η>0` coverage debt → F4).

### ▶ NEXT AGENT PICKS UP HERE: F4 (the final increment; `aic-tff` then CLOSES)

**Read `docs/research/factorize_f4_design.md` first — it is the API-verified blueprint
(638 lines).** Verdicts locked there:
- **Split F4.1 (no Julia) then F4.2 (Julia+MOSEK).** F4.1 ALONE closes the constructive
  headline (certified `Δ,Υ,B` + η=0-exact + per-instance-certified `O(η)` + the four
  duals); F4.2 is the universality-certification refinement.
- **F4.1:** build `J_DelUps = Choi(ΔΥ)−Choi(Φ)` and `J_UpsDel = Choi(ΥΔ−1_B)`; η=0 oracle
  (`ΔΥ=Φ`, `ΥΔ=1_B` exact, J=0 to machine); the always-valid eig-free per-instance UPPER
  bound `aic_cbnorm_eigfree_ball_choi` (`[‖J‖_F/n, 2‖J‖_F]`); the duals `Dec=Δ*`, `Enc=Υ*`
  (mind the swap; by `‖Λ*‖_⋄=‖Λ‖_cb` the dual defects EQUAL the primal ones — free).
- **F4.2:** the FAITHFUL `‖ΔΥ−Φ‖_cb` via `aic_cbnorm_certify` (MOSEK MAX-primal+MIN-dual,
  committed-fixture dance mirroring `gen_fixtures_opspace_o2.jl`) + the §D2 ROBUST dim-
  independence canary `C=‖ΔΥ−Φ‖_cb/η` over a `make_mixconj_blocks` dim sweep. The eig-free
  bound CANNOT do the canary (its `2N` looseness fakes a `c=O(N)` law — the §C12 trap);
  the canary needs the tight SDP. This fixture also repays the §C13(c) `m≥2 ∧ η>0` debt
  (pass `eta`, NOT the ~700× smaller `eps_assoc`, as the build's eps scale — §C11 caveat).
- **`ΥΔ−1_B`-on-`⊕M_{d_l}`:** route (i) — the ambient `M_{n_B}` Convention-A Choi
  (`n_B²×n_B²`) fed to the SQUARE self-map `aic_cbnorm_certify` (`n=n_B`, the (2/n)
  convention, Tr_2=`partial_trace_right`). NOT the rect factor-1 convention (that's for
  the asymmetric `v*`). Verify `‖ΥΔ−1_B‖_cb` (`.tex:2739`) as headline + a cheap
  un-ampliated `UpsDel2` spot-check.
- **The ONE empirical probe (not a competition — the design judged it predictable):**
  route (i) ambient-`n_B²` vs route (ii) `dim_B`-basis Choi for `ΥΔ−1_B`; η=0 is BLIND
  (J=0 both ways) so confirm at η>0 they give the same diamond norm. If it surprises,
  escalate.
- File/LOC plan: `src/aic_factorize_verify.c` (+ maybe `_dual.c`), `aic_factorize_shim.{c,h}`,
  `tools/gen_fixtures_factorize_f4.jl`, `tests/fixtures_factorize_f4.inc.h`; tests T7 (η=0
  oracle), T8 (η>0 eig-free + the route probe), T9 (MOSEK-certified canary).

**The one open escalation (NOT a wall):** the analytic composite constant `C` in
`‖ΔΥ−Φ‖_cb ≤ C·η` is a filed-research item chained after `aic-1bc` (cor_improvement `c_0`);
posture = MEASURE per-instance + assert dimension-INDEPENDENCE (not smallness — `C` may be
larger than naive since `‖v⁻¹‖_cb` is already 1.535 for oblique A). Per FINDINGS §D4 this
is BUILDABLE-MODULO, the project-standard deferral.

**First commands:** `bd show aic-tff` (F1–F3 progress in the notes); `make -j64 build/test_factorize && ./build/test_factorize` (70 green baseline, ~instant — do NOT run the serial `make test`, ~10 min; see below); then build F4.1 per the design doc §B (η=0 oracle FIRST).

**Test-speed (resolved this session — memory `make-test-speed-parallel.md`):** `make test`
~10 min is the Makefile (recompiles all 79 `src/*.c` into each of 31 binaries, no `-j`/no
`.o` caching, serial run loop). Use `make -j64 all` (~15 s build) + a parallel `xargs -P 32`
run (~184 s, gated by the `test_cstar_build` long pole) for the full gate; a single binary
during dev. Pitfall: `pkill -f "make test"` self-matches the shell → exit 144; use
`pkill -x make`.

## ▶ PRIOR CHECKPOINT (2026-05-31, session: th_main_ext O2 — certified cb UPPER bound)

Orchestrated session. **Net: opspace O2 (`aic-pjr`) is DONE — the certified Watrous-SDP
cb-norm UPPER bound `‖v‖_cb, ‖v⁻¹‖_cb ≤ 1+O(ε)` for the th_main_ext iso `v: B→A` is
realized and verified.** With O1 (HOPM lower) + O2 (SDP upper), `th_main_ext` is now
fully bracketed. `master` HEAD was `c57ef15`; this session adds the O2 stack (commit
pending at write time). **30 test binaries green** (`make test` all-green; +2 binaries
`test_opspace_choi`, `test_opspace_o2`; the two `test_corner` T9(iv) stderr "FAILED"
lines remain EXPECTED fail-loud teeth).

**What this session did (full research→pin→implement→hostile-review→fix pipeline):**
1. **Research (Sonnet web leg)** on the rectangular Watrous diamond-norm SDP (QETLAB
   `DiamondNorm` + Watrous 1207.5726). Web FACTS trusted; its DERIVATIONS (it claimed
   normalization `2/n_B`) were NOT — pinned empirically instead (per the standing rule).
2. **Pinned the convention EMPIRICALLY (the GO/NO-GO gate)** — `tools/probe_o2_pin2.jl`
   + `probe_o2_diag2.jl` against an INDEPENDENT closed-form truth (asymmetric CP map
   `‖Ψ‖_⋄=σ_max(A)²`) + a complete-isometry oracle. **GOLDEN RULE (FINDINGS §C12.O2-PIN,
   design §0.5):** build `J = choi_convA(adjoint, in, out)` (input-major) DIRECTLY, feed
   `(d_maj=in, d_min=out)` → raw optval = `‖f‖_⋄` EXACTLY, **normalization FACTOR 1**
   (corrected BOTH the design's `2/N` and the research leg's `2/n_B`); dual `tr_sys=2`
   (MINOR/output factor); primal density `:major`. `‖v‖_cb=‖v*‖_⋄` (Choi dims `(N,n_B)`),
   `‖v⁻¹‖_cb=‖(v⁻¹)*‖_⋄` (dims `(n_B,N)`).
3. **O2.1 C Choi assemblers** (`src/aic_opspace_choi.c`): `aic_opspace_choi_vstar`/
   `_vinvstar` build the adjoint Choi directly from `vE[i]`/`vinvB[k]`. 41 checks,
   mutation-proven (T1 Herm, T2 entrywise, T3 trace=carrier-rank, T4 vs J(v)).
4. **O2.3 rectangular SDP** in `src/sdp.jl` (`diamond_dual_rect`/`diamond_primal_rect`).
5. **O2.5 shim + fixtures** (`src/aic_opspace_shim.c`, `tools/gen_fixtures_opspace_o2.jl`
   → committed `tests/fixtures_opspace_o2.inc.h`, MOSEK-solved; `make test` Julia-free).
6. **O2.4 rect certifier** (`src/aic_cbnorm_certify_rect.c`): `hi=½(λmax Tr_min Y0+λmax
   Tr_min Y1)+eps·d_min`, factor 1, no η=0 short-circuit. Midpoint-radius fix (§C5/aic-2yo
   class) for the arb-assembled-J Hermiticity false-fail. Self-map `test_certify` UNTOUCHED.
7. **O2.6/.7 pipeline + tests** (`src/aic_opspace_o2.c`, `tests/test_opspace_o2.c`):
   `aic_opspace_certify_cb_upper` + the HOPM(O1)≤SDP(O2) bracket guard. 20 checks.
8. **Hostile review (Opus): NO BLOCKER** (4 mutations independently re-verified RED,
   convention chain SOUND, midpoint-rigor SOUND). 3 MINOR findings FIXED (rigorous bracket
   arb-endpoints; T5 midpoint-radius tooth; inverse-direction T3 tooth on the η=0 oracle).

**MEASURED (the headline):** η=0 oracles (block_cond_exp 4×4, noiseless_subsystem 6×3
RECTANGULAR) → `‖v‖_cb=‖v⁻¹‖_cb=[1,1]` EXACT (complete isometry). mixconj(6,2,0.03):
`‖v‖_cb=1.0019683734` (HOPM 1.001431 ≤), `‖v⁻¹‖_cb=1.5353598357` (HOPM 1.018942 ≤) —
bracket holds. **§C12 non-vacuity SHARP:** cb `‖v⁻¹‖_cb=1.535` vs vacuous Frobenius
`1/σ_min=1.027` (gap 0.51) — O2 measures the genuine operator/cb norm (the obliqueness of
`A=ImgΦ̃` inflates it; this is WHY O2≠the Frobenius σ_min proxy). Direction tooth: wrong
trace → 2.0 (η=0 rect oracle) / 4.97 (mixconj) — `tr_sys=2` pinned. Smith MOOT for O2.

---

## ▶ DETAILED HANDOFF — NEXT AGENT PICKS UP HERE: `factorize` (`th_factorization`, `aic-tff`)

`th_main` and `th_main_ext` are DONE; **`factorize` (`th_factorization`, `.tex:2730-2899`)
is the paper's FINAL headline and the only remaining constructive result.** It is now
fully unblocked — O2 supplies the last missing input (the certified cb upper bounds).

### 0. Read order before writing any code
1. `docs/research/factorize_d4_research.md` — **THE plan.** It has the 7-step pipeline
   mapped to `.tex`+modules (§1), the per-step HARD-WALL-vs-BUILDABLE-MODULO verdict (§2,
   verdict: **BUILDABLE-MODULO, not a wall**), `lem_RC` in full (§3), the interface §12
   needs (§4), the composite-`O(η)`-constant analysis (§5), and the **F1–F4 increment
   skeleton (§6)** — follow it. Note §4 was written BEFORE O2 was built ("O2 a filed
   bead"); the "O2 interface — NOW LIVE" box below SUPERSEDES §4's forward-looking adds.
2. `paper/src/approximate_algebras.tex:2730-2899` (th_factorization + lem_RC) + shard
   `paper/shards/shard-H-almost-idemp-factorization.md`.
3. `paper/FINDINGS.md` §D4 (the escalation — composite constant; BUILDABLE-MODULO),
   §C2 (the star — every product is `Φ̃(XY)`), §C12/§C12.O2/§D3 (the opspace interface),
   §A2 (the per-block-vs-embedded Pauli design — Step 4 wants the GENUINE per-block `S_jk`).
4. `MODULE_PLAN.md` L7 row (`factorize` is the last module; result→module map).

### 1. The plan (research doc §6): glue + verification, 4 increments, η=0 oracle is the spine
- **F1** — `Δ̃ = ι∘v`, `Υ̃ = v⁻¹∘Φ̃` (NON-UCP); certify `Δ̃Υ̃=Φ̃`, `Υ̃Δ̃=1_B` (exact by
  construction) + `‖Δ̃‖_cb,‖Υ̃‖_cb ≤ 1+O(η)` (← O2, see box). `.tex:2749-2767`.
- **F2** — `Δ` (Step 4): per-block 1-design `D_j` (genuine Pauli `aic_dhom_pauli`),
  `Δ'(X)=Σ_s p_s Φ(Δ̃(X U_s†)Δ̃(U_s))`, CP-check (Choi PSD), unitalize `(Δ'(I_B))^{-1/2}`
  (`aic_funcalc_pow`). `.tex:2771-2829`.
- **F3** — `lem_RC` + `Υ` (Step 5): `R_j → C_j` (partial trace over `L_j`) → `ξ_j` (top
  SVD), assert `σ_max(C_j) ≥ 1−O(η)` (Rule 4); `L_j`, `Υ'_j(X)=L_j†(Φ(X)⊗1_F)L_j`,
  unitalize. `.tex:2840-2899`.
- **F4** — end-to-end `‖ΔΥ−Φ‖_cb`, `‖ΥΔ−1_B‖_cb` (diamond SDP on Choi differences); the
  measured composite `C=‖ΔΥ−Φ‖_cb/η` bounded + dimension-independent (FINDINGS §D2 robust
  canary, NOT a within-family ratio); duals `Enc=Υ*`, `Dec=Δ*` read off. `.tex:2733-2739`.
- **THE η=0 ORACLE (build this FIRST, the cleanest cross-check, Rule 6):** for an
  EXACT-idempotent Φ, `Δ̃=ι∘v` and `Υ̃=v⁻¹∘Φ̃` must reduce to the `th_idemp_structure`
  decode (`aic_idemp_decompose`: `Δ`=inclusion, `Υ`=`Γ∘Co_M`) with `ΔΥ=Φ` and `ΥΔ=1_B`
  EXACTLY (zero defect). Reuse the `idemp`/`assoc` η=0 channels.

### 2. ▶ O2 INTERFACE — NOW LIVE (supersedes research-doc §4's "do it now" adds)
All three §4 forward-looking adds have LANDED. The next agent calls these directly:
- **`v` at n=1:** `v->vE[i] = v(E_i)` (each `N×N`), from `aic_cstar_build`'s `aic_dhom_v`.
  `Δ̃(X) = Σ_i x_i vE[i]` (ambient `N×N`). No change needed (`include/aic_dhom.h`).
- **`v⁻¹` builder (for `Υ̃ = v⁻¹∘Φ̃`):** `aic_opspace_build_vinv(&vinvB, &dim_A, &n_B, v,
  prec)` → `vinvB[k] = v⁻¹(B_k)` (each `n_B×n_B`), free with `aic_opspace_vinv_clear`
  (`include/aic_opspace.h`). This is the SAME inverse O2 certifies — use it, don't re-derive.
- **Inverse Smith level:** `aic_opspace_result.n_B` (= `Σ_l d_l`); block dims from `v->B->d`.
- **Certified cb UPPER bounds (the `tilde_DelUps` inputs `‖Δ̃‖_cb,‖Υ̃‖_cb ≤ 1+O(η)`):**
  `aic_opspace_result.cb_upper` (= `‖v‖_cb`) and `cbinv_upper` (= `‖v⁻¹‖_cb`), filled by
  `aic_opspace_certify_cb_upper(r, v, Y0_fwd, Y1_fwd, Y0_inv, Y1_inv, prec)` (after
  `aic_opspace_certify` fills O1). **PRACTICAL CAVEAT (the one thing to plan for):** those
  `(Y0,Y1)` are Watrous-SDP **dual feasible points** that come from a MOSEK solve — there
  is NO pure-C runtime SDP. So to certify the cb-upper bound for a factorize FIXTURE
  channel you must (a) extend `tools/gen_fixtures_opspace_o2.jl`'s corpus with that channel
  (it ccalls `aic_opspace_choi_shim_d` then solves + commits the feasible points to
  `tests/fixtures_opspace_o2.inc.h`), then (b) read them in the C test. The η=0 oracle and
  the O1 HOPM lower bound need NO MOSEK — only the certified η>0 UPPER bound does.
- **IMPORTANT — `‖v⁻¹‖_cb` can be notably > 1 at finite η** (measured 1.535 for
  mixconj(6,2,0.03), η-proxy 0.05) because `A=ImgΦ̃` is OBLIQUE — this is the GENUINE
  operator/cb norm (NOT the Frobenius σ_min proxy 1.027; §C12). `factorize`'s composite
  constant inherits this, so the measured `C` may be larger than naive; the canary must
  confirm it does NOT grow with dim (it is dim-independent, just not tiny).

### 3. Key reuse map (all CLOSED + green)
`aic_assoc_regularize`/`aic_assoc_ecstar_from_phi` (Φ̃, A, star — Steps 1-2);
`aic_cstar_build` (the iso v — Step 3); `aic_opspace_*` (cb-certificate — see box);
`aic_dhom_pauli` (the genuine per-block `S_jk` 1-design — Step 4, NOT the embedded
`aic_dhom_diag_build` sum, §A2); `aic_ucp_*` (Choi/Stinespring/compose/CP-check);
`aic_funcalc_pow` (inverse-sqrt unitalization); `aic_idemp_decompose` (η=0 oracle decode);
`aic_cbnorm_*` / the diamond SDP (F4 `‖ΔΥ−Φ‖_cb`); `aic_mat_partial_trace_*` + SVD (lem_RC).

### 4. Gotchas inherited (don't relearn the hard way)
- **The star (§C2):** every product in `A` is `Φ̃(XY)` via `aic_ucp_apply`, never plain
  `acb_mat_mul`. The η=0 identity channel is BLIND to this — test on an oblique/η>0 fixture
  with a star→plain mutation guard.
- **A is OBLIQUE (§C3/§C4):** project into A with `Φ̃` (= `·⋆I`), not the Frobenius `Π_A`.
- **cb ≠ operator ≠ Frobenius (§C12):** the cb bounds are the OPERATOR-norm objects; the
  Frobenius σ_min is vacuous for ampliation. F4's `‖·‖_cb` must be the diamond SDP, not a
  Frobenius surrogate.
- **The composite constant (§D4/§5) is the ONE open item** — posture (matches `c_0`,
  opspace): MEASURE `C` per instance, assert bounded + dim-independent (the §D2 robust
  canary: bounded abs-max + no-upward-trend over an n-sweep), file the ANALYTIC `C` as a
  research bead chained after `aic-1bc`. Do NOT block on it; do NOT fake it.
- **Convention-pinning lesson (this session, §C12.O2-PIN):** for any new SDP/norm
  convention, PIN it empirically against an independent oracle — do NOT trust a derivation
  (design doc OR LLM research leg; both were wrong on the O2 normalization). Sonnet for
  survey, Opus/empirics for derivation.

### 5. O2 loose ends (this session) the next agent may want to close
- **The cb-norm UNIVERSALITY canary is NOT yet a dim-sweep at O2** — `‖v‖_cb`,`‖v⁻¹‖_cb`
  are checked per-instance + the HOPM≤SDP bracket only (O1's `a_cb_flat` is the lower-bound
  analogue). If `factorize` (or a reviewer) needs the `.tex:484` dimension-independence
  certified at O2, add a dim-sweep canary (extend the fixture corpus + a test like
  `cstar_build` T2b). File a bead if pursued.
- **O2's certified bound needs committed MOSEK feasible points** (§2 caveat) — the corpus
  in `tools/gen_fixtures_opspace_o2.jl` is 3 channels; extend it for new test channels.
- **Precision posture:** O1's `cb_forward`/`a_cb` are DOUBLE gate midpoints (HOPM);
  O2's `cb_upper`/`cbinv_upper` are RIGOROUS arb upper bounds restored from the committed
  double feasible points (the midpoint-radius fix, §C12.O2-SUBTLETY). The η=0 oracle is
  exact `[1,1]`.
- **`aic-0at`** (the ecstar axiom-defect SDP upper bound) is a DISTINCT, still-OPEN bead —
  NOT closed by O2 (which is the opspace cb-norm SDP). Don't conflate.

### 6. First commands

## ▶ PRIOR CHECKPOINT (2026-05-31, session: canary fix + th_main_ext O1)

Orchestrated session. **Net: a RED headline canary on committed `master` was found
and fixed, D3 was resolved, the endgame was assessed, PR #1 merged, and `opspace`
O1 (th_main_ext) landed.** Current state: `master` clean and pushed (HEAD
**`e9319cb`**), **28 test binaries green** (`make test: all tests passed`, ~5 min;
the two `test_corner` T9(iv) + the `idemp_decompose` "FAIL" stderr lines are
EXPECTED fail-loud teeth). New module `opspace`, +1 binary (`test_opspace`, 89 checks).

**What this session did (commits `f9d2229`→`e9319cb`):**
1. **Fixed a RED headline canary (`f9d2229`, bead `aic-gf2`).** Committed HEAD's
   `test_cstar_build` T2b (the `.tex:484` dimension-independence canary) was
   DETERMINISTICALLY FAILING (m=3 within-family c-ratio 6.90 > 2.5) — contradicting
   the prior session's "th_main COMPLETE / 27 green / m=3 ratio 2.05" claim (an
   over-claim: that committed state was never green). Deep investigation (prec
   256≡512 byte-for-byte) proved **th_main is SOUND**: the constant c=iso/η is
   BOUNDED [0.25, 3.27] over n=4..10 and does NOT grow with dim (both families peak
   at the n=7 Heisenberg-Weyl geometry then crash at n=8 — fixture-geometry noise,
   all isos healthy). The flawed within-family ratio metric (it measured geometry
   SPREAD, not dim-GROWTH) was replaced with a robust **bounded abs-max + no-upward-
   trend** canary, mutation-proven (FINDINGS §C11/§D2).
2. **Resolved D3 (`f9d2229`, bead `aic-2jd` CLOSED).** Smith's lemma (Pisier Prop
   1.12 / Watrous TQI Thm 3.46) makes the cb-truncation a THEOREM: `‖v‖_cb=‖1_{M_N}⊗v‖_op`,
   N_max=N forward / n_B inverse. Two research legs in `docs/research/opspace_{paper,web}_leg.md`.
3. **Merged PR #1 (`b646211`).** A SessionStart hook auto-provisioning FLINT+LAPACK
   on ephemeral web containers (`$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`-guarded, no-op locally).
4. **Assessed `factorize`/D4 (`0db6194`, `docs/research/factorize_d4_research.md`).**
   th_factorization is **BUILDABLE-MODULO, NOT a hard wall** (FINDINGS §D4): Steps 4-5
   are prose but every object is explicit finite-dim (the 1-design CP-ization reuses
   `aic_dhom_pauli`; `lem_RC` is a constructive partial-trace+SVD). Only open item =
   the composite O(η) CONSTANT (certification gap, handled per-instance + canary like c₀).
5. **Built `opspace` O1 (`e9319cb`, bead `aic-zwo` in_progress).** The FAITHFUL
   operator-norm cb-inclusion `a_n = inf ‖(1_{M_n}⊗v)(X)‖_op/‖X‖_op` (NOT the vacuous
   Frobenius σ_min, §C12) via an operator-norm HOPM over the existing `v` from
   `aic_cstar_build` (v reused unchanged — opspace is CERTIFICATION). η=0 oracle
   (complete isometry, a_n=1 exact), prop_inc_ext doubling, operator-norm universality
   canary, a STRUCTURAL ampliation tooth (catches the (0,0)-block-only MUTATION-D the
   hostile review found passing all prior checks — orchestrator independently
   re-verified RED). Research→implement→hostile-review→fix→commit (the review caught a
   §C12-class "test that cannot fail"; closed). O1 is a HOPM **lower** bound.

**▶ NEXT AGENT PICKS UP HERE — O2 (bead `aic-pjr`), the certified cb UPPER bound.**
O1 gives only the operator-norm HOPM *lower* bound on `‖v_n‖`; the certified
`‖v‖_cb ≤ 1+O(η)` (and `‖v⁻¹‖_cb`) needs the Watrous cb-norm SDP. **Design is written:
`docs/research/opspace_o2_design.md`** (READ IT). Key points: `‖v‖_cb=‖v*‖_⋄`, feed
`J(v*)=J(v)^T` (Choi Convention A) into the EXISTING `src/sdp.jl` + `aic_cbnorm_certify`
pipeline GENERALIZED to a RECTANGULAR `(d_in,d_out)` map; **Smith is MOOT for O2** (the
SDP captures all ampliations intrinsically — one Choi, one solve, no level sweep);
**THE RISK = the partial-trace DIRECTION** (the exact bug that bit the original cbnorm
work — for `J(v*)` the input dim sits MAJOR/left, likely needs `partial_trace_left`;
pin with an asymmetric η>0 fixture + the η=0 oracle `‖v‖_cb=1`). Needs Julia+MOSEK
(SERIAL — no parallel Julia) + the committed-fixture pattern (so `make test` stays
Julia-free). The HOPM(O1) ≤ SDP(O2) bracket is the key cross-check (the `aic-0at` rung).
The §12/factorize INTERFACE adds are ALREADY in O1: public `aic_opspace_build_vinv`
(v⁻¹ builder) + `n_B` on `aic_opspace_result`. After O2, `factorize` (`aic-tff`,
buildable-modulo) is the final headline.

**New docs this session:** `docs/research/{opspace_paper_leg,opspace_web_leg,opspace_o2_design,factorize_d4_research}.md`.

Orientation for a fresh agent. Last updated **2026-05-30** (below; see the checkpoint
above for the 2026-05-31 session), after an orchestrated
session that built **almost the entire `th_main` pipeline** — the constructive
proof of the main theorem (`tex:460`: any finite-dim ε-C* algebra is
`O(ε)`-isomorphic to a genuine C* algebra, with a *dimension-independent*
constant). Four modules landed, each through the full research → implement →
verify → **hostile-review → fix** → commit pipeline (the hostile review caught a
**real blocker every time** — see the per-module blocks below):
- **`corner`** (§7, bead `aic-czm`, CLOSED) — `Co_{P,Q}` compressions, `S_{P,Q}`,
  compressed product, `lem_alpha`, `lem_PQ_Hilb`, the **Ha-map**, `lem_PQR`,
  `lem_1d_proj`. 3 increments, 134 checks.
- **`projection`** (§6, bead `aic-mqf`, CLOSED) — the **constructivization crux**
  (`lem_nontriv_projection`): ambient spectral split of a Hermitian element of A,
  projected into A via `Φ̃`. 58 checks.
- **`dhom`** (§8, bead `aic-c1n`, CLOSED) — `prop_delta_hominc` + `lem_approx`
  (the multiplicativity-defect Newton iteration with the explicit Pauli diagonal).
  89 checks.
- **`errreduce`** (§8/9, bead `aic-t81`, CLOSED) — `cor_improvement`; the **c₀
  universality canary** lives here and is FLAT (dimension-independent — the
  headline `tex:484` correctness check passes). 51 checks.

Also created **`paper/FINDINGS.md`** — a living log of `.tex` typos / formula
errors / non-constructive steps / load-bearing subtleties / open escalations,
wired into the CLAUDE.md read order (step 6). **Read it.** Two confirmed `.tex`
findings this session: §A1 (`tex:1109` `lem_alpha` β subscript `Q_j`→`Q_k`) and
§A2 (`tex:1254` direct-sum diagonal is non-central for the finite Pauli design;
the correct one is the embedded sum `Σ_l D_l`).

**LATEST (2026-05-31, orchestrated th_main-completion session): `th_main` is
DONE — `cstar_build` COMPLETE (I1–I5), bead `aic-097` CLOSED.** The constructive
`O(ε)`-isomorphism `v: B → A` (proof of `th_main`, `.tex:1414-1444`) is realized
and verified: the η=0 oracle produces `B = ⊕_C M_{|C|}` matching the INDEPENDENT
`aic_idemp_decompose` block decomposition EXACTLY with zero defect, and the
`.tex:484` universality canary is FLAT (constant = 0 over dim_A 8..20 — the
dimension-independent-constant claim HOLDS). This session landed: I4 `lem_extension`
(two-parallel-impl synthesis + hostile review + U₁-gap fix), the **aic-qgs**
substrate fix (opnorm/svals now handle Grams with accumulated radius via a Weyl
midpoint+R enclosure — this unblocked the oblique S_P-wrapper corner path I5 needs),
and I5 `aic_cstar_build` (the 3-stage master loop; two-parallel-impl synthesis +
hostile review). New binaries: `test_cstar_extension` (n=32), `test_cstar_build`
(n=63).

Current state: `master` clean (pushed to `origin`), **27 test binaries green,
zero warnings**, `make test` all-green (the two `test_corner` T9(iv) "FAILED"
stderr lines are EXPECTED forked mutation-teeth, not failures). `make test` ~5 min.
Read `paper/FINDINGS.md` §C (the "tests that can't fail" the reviews keep catching:
**star vs plain product** blindness §C2, the **oblique-`Φ̃`-not-`Π_A`** projection
§C3, **rem_X2** §C1, the unit-is-`Ptilde`-not-`1_n` §C7, §C11 the I5 subtleties).
**§C5/§C10 (the `aic-qgs` Gram false-fail) is now RESOLVED** — the
`aic_corner_gamma_opnorm_ub` workaround is retireable (separate cleanup).

**th_main is now FULLY ROBUST.** Beyond the I1–I5 build, this session also fixed
every substrate blocker the oblique master loop exposed: **aic-qgs** (the
`aic_mat_opnorm` Gram-Hermiticity false-fail → Weyl midpoint+R enclosure, CLOSED),
the **aic_sgn radius-floor wall** (`aic-1vp`: midpoint-iterate + a-posteriori
certificate, CLOSED), and the **m≥3 G-twist involution-tol** (the `extension.c`
`lem_approx` caller: `eps_target=O(η)`, `unit_tol=2.0` for the Ha-twisted codomain).
The η=0 oracle is EXACT vs `idemp_decompose`; the `.tex:484` universality canary is
flat (η=0) and bounded across m≥3 (η>0); the η>0 MULTI-CLASS merge is exercised
(`test_cstar_build` n=101). All 27 binaries green.

**▶ NEXT FRONTIER (th_main complete + robust; the remaining paper results):**
1. **`th_main_ext` (§10 `opspace`, `aic-zwo`)** — the tensor/cb-norm extension
   (`1_{M_n}⊗v` is a δ-iso for the SAME δ, all n, `tex:1447-1561`). THE next module.
   Constructive modulo the **cb-truncation `N`** (open escalation **D3**/`aic-2jd`:
   "for all n" must be truncated, conjecture `n≤dim A` — needs proof or a certified-N
   procedure before a cb-bound is rigorous; the ampliation machinery + conjectured-N
   tests are buildable now). Research §10 first (is D3 a hard wall or buildable-modulo?).
2. **`factorize` (`th_factorization`, `aic-tff`)** — the paper's FINAL headline,
   gated by `th_main_ext`. Carries the **D4 stop condition** (`aic-1sk`): the proof is
   an OUTLINE (Steps 4–5 CP-ization are prose; the composite O(η) constant unstated).
   Per the mandate this is a documented escalation — reaching it means surfacing it.
3. **Robustness/cleanup** (non-blocking): `aic-5aq` (operator-ON corner basis → G=I →
   recover the tight involution tol), `aic-92i` (superseded by aic-5aq), the
   `aic_corner_gamma_opnorm_ub` workaround retirement (now that aic-qgs is fixed),
   the Julia `ccall` layer (E5).

## ✅ COMPLETE (historical design notes) — `cstar_build` (§9 master loop, bead `aic-097`, CLOSED) = the proof of `th_main`

**This section is now HISTORICAL** (cstar_build shipped I1–I5; see the LATEST block
above for the current state and the NEXT FRONTIER). The design notes below remain a
useful map of how the master loop was assembled.

**Originally updated 2026-05-30 (orchestrated cstar_build session).** `cstar_build` was the
**only remaining `th_main` step**: it assembles the four CLOSED modules below into
the constructive `O(ε)`-isomorphism `v: B → A`. Being built as **5 increments**
(I1–I5) per the design doc **`docs/research/cstar_build_design.md`** — READ THAT
FIRST (it verifies the data model against the `.tex` and maps every assembly lemma
to existing-API call sequences), plus shard E (`paper/shards/shard-E-…`) and
`tex:1321-1446`. **THE DATA-MODEL LINCHPIN (design §1):** compressed subalgebras
`S_P` are re-presented as derived `aic_ecstar` objects (star = compressed product
`Co_P(Φ̃(XY))`, unit `Ptilde`, basis = corner-extract) via the `star_phi`/`star_ctx`
seam, so `projection`/`corner`/`dhom`/`errreduce` recurse on `S_P` UNCHANGED. The
running iso is an `aic_dhom_v` over `B = ⊕_l M_{d_l}`.

**DONE this session (committed + pushed to `origin/master`, working tree clean):**
- `284b11f` **design doc** (`docs/research/cstar_build_design.md`).
- `4d40af2` **I1** — `aic_cstar_subalgebra` (S_P-as-ecstar wrapper, `src/aic_cstar_subalg.c`)
  + `aic_cstar_matrix_algebra` (genuine M_d ecstar, `src/aic_cstar_matalg.c`).
  Hostile-reviewed (Opus); F1/F2/F3 fixed (F2 = `star_ctx` decoupled to a heap block
  so the owner is RELOCATION-SAFE for the I5 array of wrappers; F1 = independent
  plain-matmul oracle; F3 = genuinely-oblique `mixconj` teeth). `test_cstar` n=35.
- `f95a060` **I2** — `aic_cstar_lem_add_dim` (`tex:1363`) + `aic_cstar_off_diag_zero`
  (Stage-3 `S_{P_C,P_D}=0`) + `aic_cstar_merge_sum` (`cor_merge_sum`, `tex:1352`),
  in `src/aic_cstar_merge.c`. `test_cstar_merge` n=29.
- `ae48fe3` **I3** — `aic_cstar_lem_merging` (`tex:1325`, general 2×2 block assembly),
  `src/aic_cstar_merging.c`. `test_cstar_merging` n=27. **⚠️ HOSTILE REVIEW PENDING**
  (implementation is green + subagent-self-verified, but did NOT get the mandatory
  independent hostile review — the session was wound up here). Surfaced FINDINGS §C9
  (the `two_block` subtlety: `B` is `M_{n1+n2}` single-block with LIVE off-diagonal
  γ for lem_extension, vs `M_{n1}⊕M_{n2}` two-block = cor_merge_sum; a single block
  with zeroed off-diagonal is an INVALID input).

**▶ NEXT AGENT PICKS UP HERE (in order):**
1. **Hostile-review I3** (`src/aic_cstar_merging.c` + `tests/test_cstar_merging.c`) —
   the mandatory Core-tier review that was deferred. Hunt the routing convention
   (`route_unit`, the single off-by-one risk), the merging-condition guards, and any
   "test that can't fail." Fix + mutation-prove, then amend/commit.
2. **I4 — `lem_extension`** (`tex:1378`, `src/aic_cstar_extension.c`), THE SUBSTANTIVE
   lemma + highest risk. 6 steps (design §4.4): (1) `dim S_{P,Q}=n` via lem_add_dim;
   (2) the Ha-maps `h_{jk}=Ha^Q_{P_j,P_k}` (`aic_corner_ha`); (3) approximate `h_11∘v`
   by an exact hom `μ_11` via `lem_approx` (`aic_dhom_approx`) with codomain
   `B(S_{P,Q})≅M_n` = `aic_cstar_matrix_algebra(n)` (built in I1); (4) `U_1` from the
   polar/SVD of `μ_11` (`aic_latd_svd` + a ~10-LOC polar extractor); (5) the four
   `γ_{jk}` (`tex:1405-1410`: γ_11=v, γ_12=U_1, γ_21=(U_1(·†))†, γ_22=·Qtilde);
   (6) assemble via `aic_cstar_lem_merging` (I3, `two_block=0`). **Highest-risk: the
   Ha-map index bookkeeping** (`aic_corner.h` flags it; swap-P-and-R mutation MUST be
   RED). Hostile review MANDATORY.
3. **I5 — the master loop** (`tex:1414`, `src/aic_cstar_build.c` + the public entry in
   `include/aic_cstar.h`): Stage 1 greedy projection→1d skeleton + equivalence classes
   (`aic_corner_equiv_1d`), Stage 2 per-class inductive `lem_extension`+`errreduce`,
   Stage 3 merge classes via `cor_merge_sum`+`errreduce`. Headline tests: η=0 oracle
   (zero defect, `th_idemp_structure` block sizes) + the **universality canary** (c₀
   flat over dim A — inherits `errreduce` T4). Carry FINDINGS §C8 (merged-`v` defect
   teeth need the `c=defect/η` MAGNITUDE bound, not just the η-shrink direction) and
   §G1/§C7 (`aic_projection_nontrivial`'s internal nontriviality assert uses the
   ambient `1_n`, vacuous on an S_P wrapper — check `||Ptilde−P'||` externally; I1 T3
   shows the pattern). Hostile review MANDATORY.

In-session increment tracking was via TaskCreate (ephemeral): I1/I2 completed,
I3 done-pending-review, I4/I5 pending. Bead `aic-097` stays **in_progress**.

**The 3-stage loop (the I5 target, `tex:1414-1444`):**
1. **Stage 1 (commutative skeleton):** repeatedly apply `projection` (aic-mqf) on the
   `S_{P_m}` wrappers to split A; force projections 1-dimensional (`lem_1d_proj`);
   classify into equivalence classes (`lem_PQR` transitivity); merge via
   `cor_merge_sum` (I2) + reset error via `errreduce`.
2. **Stage 2:** the inductive `lem_extension` (I4) per class + `errreduce` after each.
3. **Stage 3:** `cor_merge_sum` (I2) over classes + `errreduce` → `B = ⊕_C M_{|C|}`.

**Reuse map (all CLOSED + green):** `aic_projection_nontrivial`, `aic_corner_*`
(Co/S/cdot/alpha/ip_1d/**ha**/dim_S/equiv_1d/Ptilde), `aic_dhom_approx`, `aic_errreduce`,
`aic_dhom_v_sigma_min`, `aic_latd_svd`. PLUS the new cstar I1–I3 helpers above.
The η=0 oracle: exact-idempotent Φ → A genuine C* → `v` an **exact** iso (zero defect).

**Known open escalations feeding cstar_build** (see `paper/FINDINGS.md` §D):
`aic-3qv` (Ω(1) gap for `projection` — per-instance certified, universal open);
`aic-1bc` (analytic `c₀` — only the *measured* c₀ exists); `aic-w4o.1` (certified
degenerate eig — extraction is double-path, defects arb-certified). None block the
constructive double-path route; certification defers.

**th_main_ext (§10, `opspace`, `aic-zwo`) and `factorize` (`th_factorization`,
`aic-tff`) come AFTER cstar_build** — user scoped this work to plain `th_main`.

---

**`aic-8hz` (this session, CLOSED, committed).** funcalc now has a globally-
convergent non-normal matrix-`sgn` reaching the full SPECTRAL `ρ(I−X²)<1` regime,
eig-free (no `aic-w4o.1` dependency). Route: Newton `½(Y+Y⁻¹)` (Higham *Functions
of Matrices* Thm 5.6, global+quadratic) gated by a **Gelfand precondition**
`‖M^k‖_F^{1/k}<1` on `M=I−X²` (`k=1` = the old op/Frobenius basin; non-normal needs
a few powers; `k_max=32`, fail loud), + an a-posteriori `‖Y²−I‖`/`‖XY−YX‖`
certificate (fires at prec=53). `aic_sgn` auto-dispatches (in-basin Newton–Schulz
byte-for-byte, else global Newton); **`aic_prop_P` relaxed to the spectral
`ρ(P²−P)<1/4`**, so `theta`/`prop_P`/`aic_assoc_regularize` now reach the full
NON-NORMAL `η<1/4` regime (`assoc_ecsa` near-boundary/large-n robustness). New
`src/aic_funcalc_global.c` (200 LOC), `tests/test_funcalc_global.c` (n=12). Teeth:
2×2 closed-form oracle (Mathematica-confirmed 2 ways to 58 digits) + `test_assoc2`
**U6** assoc payoff (oblique channel, `‖S²−S‖_op=0.42≥¼` OLD aborts, `ρ=0.21` cert
`4ρ<1` at k=6 → `S̃²=S̃` to 8.9e-70) with a **unitality** sign witness `Φ̃(1)=1`
(`‖S̃·vec(I)−vec(I)‖=4e-70` vs `√n=2` for −sgn), mutation-proven. Hostile review:
no blockers; 3 non-blocking findings all fixed inline. Deferred: scaled-Newton
(Kenney–Laub) Pareto candidate → bead **`aic-68c`** (P3; only if iteration/k counts
climb near `η→¼`). Docs: `ALGORITHM.md` §"Module funcalc — global sgn",
`docs/research/sgn_global_research.md`.

**`aic-dbo.2` Increment 1 (this session, committed; bead stays in_progress for
Inc2).** The adversarial-instance corpus: `tests/aic_adversarial.{h,c}` +
`aic_adversarial_nla.c` + driver `tests/test_adversarial.c` (n=32 self-tests, all
mutation-proven). 7 representative NLA generators spanning the distinct attack
modes + the lethal shortlist, each with a tunable knob, deterministic construction
(gen2 = fixed-LCG seed), and a certified-arb self-test asserting the knob produces
the claimed property: gen1 `jordan_t13` (1a, tex:540; ρ=t^{1/3}), gen2
`nonnormal_tri` (2c; the aic-8hz op-vs-ρ gap regime, `‖[X,X†]‖_F` 0.07→172 as
c 0.1→10), gen3 `degenerate_proj` (4b, lethal #1; exact {0,1} projector the
simple-eig path can't isolate), gen4 `near_degen_herm` (4a; gap knob), gen5
`graded_diag` (5c; κ knob to 1e8), gen6 `boundary_x2I` (7a, lethal #5; `‖X²−I‖`
straddles 1), gen7 `propP_delta` (7b; `‖P²−P‖=δ` at the ¼ edge). The Makefile now
links `tests/aic_*.c` (TEST_HELPER_SRC) into every test/bench. **The corpus already
paid off**: gen5 surfaced a real substrate bug → bead **`aic-2yo`** (FIXED + closed
this session): `aic_mat_int_assert_hermitian`'s ABSOLUTE tol false-failed on a
graded/ill-conditioned Gram (the flagged asymmetry was the ball RADIUS, which grows
with magnitude), so `aic_mat_singular_values`/`opnorm` ABORTED for condition number
≳ 1e2 (precision-independent). Fix: a RELATIVE + absolute-floor tol
`tol·(1+|H_ij|+|H_ji|)`, refactored into a non-aborting predicate
`aic_mat_int_is_hermitian` so the teeth (genuine non-Hermitian still rejected) are
testable; `test_mat` test7 (n=29) mutation-proven, full `make test` green.
Increment 2 (still open on `aic-dbo.2`): the DOMAIN/channel families
(`docs/adversarial/domain.md` — several gated by unbuilt modules) + the remaining
NLA families; unblocks the universality canary `aic-dbo.3` once the `ε~c/dim` dim-
sweep instances land. `test_adversarial.c` (451 LOC) joins the oversized-test-file
pile `aic-w4o.4`.

**⚠️ RESUME HERE — `aic-92f` (`assoc_ecsa`, `th_almost_idemp`) is CLOSED; the
paper's `th_almost_idemp` is now VERIFIED end-to-end.** This session built
Φ̃=θ(2Φ−1) (regularization to an exact-idempotent superoperator), A=ImgΦ̃, the
Choi–Effros star X⋆Y=Φ̃(XY), and the full extended-O(η)-$C^*$ axiom verification —
including the **dimension-independence universality canary** (flat, so the paper's
universal-constant claim `.tex:2193` HOLDS; no stop-condition). Two Opus hostile
reviews each caught a "test that cannot fail" (untested foundational
`aic_mat_herm_max_eig` near-zero fallback; toothless canary threshold; unasserted
C* defect); all fixed + mutation-proven. Closed `aic-3qq` (Π_A teeth on the η>0
non-polar-closed A, `test_assoc2` U4) along the way.

**The paper's FINAL headline is `aic-tff` (`factorize`, `th_factorization`
`.tex:2730`)** — the approximate factorization Φ*≈Enc∘Dec through a genuine $C^*$
algebra B. It is **NOT directly unblocked**: th_factorization Step 3 invokes
`th_main_ext`, i.e. the entire incremental $C^*$-algebra construction (E2-eps:
`unitfix`/`unitary`/`projection`/`corner`; E3-mainthm: `dhom`/`errreduce`/
`cstar_build`; §10 `opspace`), and its proof is an OUTLINE with open escalations
(shard H §"Open implementation questions"; MODULE_PLAN escalations 1,4,5). So the
real next constructive frontier is the **th_main pipeline**. `bd ready` P1: the
recurring `aic-w4o.1` (certified DEGENERATE Hermitian eig — gates the certified
halves of `projection`/Kraus/subspace extraction, deferred all session) and
`aic-dbo.2` (adversarial instance generators). `aic-8hz` (globally-convergent
non-normal `sgn`) is now **CLOSED** (see the top block); `aic-erz` (cut the canary
runtime) stays open, and `aic-4c7` stays open (the U2/U3 O(η) sweep used an op-norm
η-PROXY; closing it needs the certified cb-η normalization to rule out a proxy↔cb-η
dimension factor).

**`assoc_ecsa` (this session, `aic-92f` Increments 1+2, commits `96f381e` + this
one).** Realizes `th_almost_idemp` (`.tex:2162-2237`) as a finite-dim algorithm.
- **Φ̃=θ(2Φ−1)** is `prop_P` applied to Φ at the **n²×n² superoperator** level:
  build S_Φ column-by-column via the tested `aic_ucp_apply` on E_pq (row-major
  vec; oracle-tested + Kronecker cross-check `S_Φ=Σ K_a†⊗K_aᵀ`), then
  `aic_assoc_regularize`=`aic_prop_P(S_Φ)` (reuse `funcalc`; default sgn=
  Newton-Schulz, eig-free → sound on the NON-NORMAL superoperator). Φ̃ is NOT CP
  (`.tex:363`). `include/aic_assoc.h`, `src/aic_assoc_superop.c`,
  `src/aic_assoc_regularize.c`; `tests/test_assoc.c` n=93.
- **A=ImgΦ̃** = range of the OBLIQUE idempotent S̃, extracted by thin SVD
  (`dim_A=round(trace)` cross-checked vs SVD-gap@0.5; top-dim_A left singular
  vectors → Frobenius-ON basis {B_k}). Nonzero σ(S̃)≥1, =1 iff Φ̃ HS-self-adjoint
  (self-dual Φ), >1 genuinely oblique (`compress_idemp`, σ=√3). `aic_assoc_extract.c`.
- **Star + verification:** the `ecstar` data model was generalized BACKWARD-
  COMPATIBLY (`star_phi`/`star_ctx` apply-fn seam; Kraus path byte-identical →
  `test_ecstar` n=109 unchanged) so X⋆Y=Φ̃(XY) feeds the existing axiom-defect
  estimators. `aic_assoc_algebra.c`; `tests/test_assoc2.c` n=139: U1 η=0 oracle
  (machine-zero, A matches `aic_idemp`'s ImgΦ), U2 real η>0 (assoc+cstar O(η),
  vanishing, teeth), U3 universality canary (flat over dim_A=4..16, threshold 2.0,
  mutation-proven vs linear+√(dim) injection), U4 Π_A on non-polar-closed A, U5
  oblique σ_max.
- **Load-bearing decisions/findings:** (i) funcalc's sgn asserts the FROBENIUS
  basin 4‖S²−S‖_F<1 — dimension-dependent, holds at η=0/small η, TRIPS near η→1/4
  / large n → bead `aic-8hz`. (ii) A is built from the MIDPOINT of S̃ (funcalc-
  iteration balls ~5e-75 trip `aic_mat_opnorm`'s Hermiticity tol when squared into
  the Gram); rigor lives in I1's η=0 + non-normal A1-vs-A2 cross-checks (same class
  as the double-extraction / `aic-w4o.1` deferral). (iii) A=ImgΦ̃ is EXACTLY
  idempotent, so its associator vanishes for self-dual/compatible families —
  genuine non-associativity needs two INCOMPATIBLE algebras mixed (the η>0 family
  is dep(d)⊕conj(dep(d)); obliqueness ≠ non-associativity, distinct properties).
  (iv) A foundational fix landed in `src/aic_mat_spectral.c`: `aic_mat_herm_max_eig`
  falls back to the rigorous eig-free [−‖H‖_F,‖H‖_F] on a non-finite certifier
  radius (near-zero degenerate Gram), now with a direct mutation-proof test in
  `test_mat.c` n=23. Research: `docs/research/assoc_ecsa_research.md`.

**`ecstar` (this session, `aic-knm` Cycles 1+2, committed `124ed68`/`4c623bf`).**
A = subspace of $M_n$ as an orthonormal operator basis {B_k} (reshaped from
`aic_idemp_decomp.Delta`) + a borrowed UCP map Φ; star X⋆Y=Φ(XY) (`aic_ucp_apply`,
NOT plain XY); norm = operator norm; unit I=1_n; all inherited from B(H)
(verified vs `.tex:2186-2215`). Two audition rungs for the defect estimators
(assoc/submult/cstar/involution/unit), per the Pareto discipline:
- **Cycle 1 — certified-arb BASIS-SWEEP** (`src/aic_ecstar{,_assoc,_defect,_involution}.c`):
  max over basis tuples, the cheap EXACT zero-detector for the η=0 oracle (machine-
  zero on 7 idemp channels incl. a complex-conjugated ASYMMETRIC one) + always-zero
  invariants (involution/unit are structural for HP unital Φ). Hostile review caught
  the signature "test that can't fail" twice (involution no-op; transposed reshape) —
  both fixed (shared generic-apply core; asymmetric channel) and re-mutation-proven.
- **Cycle 2 — faithful HOPM worst-case** (`src/aic_ecstar_{hopm,iterate,search,setup,certify}.c`):
  scale-invariant alternating max over the OPERATOR-norm ball (closed-form u,v power
  step + Π_A(polar(C)) block step with a monotone-ascent accept-guard), double-path
  search → arb-certified LOWER bound on the witness. The **universality canary**
  (HOPM defect/t flat across dim_A=8→45, vs the basis-sweep which drifts) is the
  payoff: HOPM avoids the d^{3/2} Frobenius trap the basis-sweep pays.
- Findings (load-bearing): submult is structurally ≤0 for ANY UCP star; the η=0
  oracle is structurally BLIND to whether Φ is in the star (only the perturbation
  teeth pin the Choi-Effros product); the Π_A accept-guard's CORRECTNESS half is
  untestable until a η>0 (non-polar-closed) A exists → bead `aic-3qq` (needs
  `aic-92f`). Cycle 3 (certified SDP UPPER bound, Watrous bilinear + SOS trilinear)
  = bead `aic-0at`. Research: `docs/research/ecstar_{paper,web}_leg.md`.

**cb-norm / η-defect stack (this session, `aic-m24` CLOSED + `aic-cne`).** The
central quantity η = ‖Φ²−Φ‖_cb now has a full certified pipeline:
- **eig-free bracket** `[‖J‖_F/n, 2‖J‖_F]` (`src/aic_cbnorm.c`) — always-valid,
  no solver, no eig (dodges `aic-w4o.1`); the fallback near η=0.
- **value entry point** `eta_idempotence(kraus)` (`julia/AlmostIdempotentChannels.jl`,
  ccalls the `libaic.so` shim `aic_ucp_choi_diff_d` then solves the Watrous SDP via
  Convex+MOSEK) — downstream modules MEASURE η through this.
- **tight certified-arb ball** `aic_cbnorm_certify` (`src/aic_cbnorm_certify*.c`) —
  rigorous `[lo,hi]`, widths ~1e-12 (~10¹²× tighter than eig-free), from two MOSEK
  feasible points (MAX primal + MIN dual solved separately in Julia, `src/sdp.jl`)
  via arb feasibility-restoration (convex-combination LOWER toward the Slater
  center; eigenvalue-shift UPPER; one-sided `herm_max_eig` PSD certs; dispatch +
  fail-loud). Hostile-reviewed (no blockers); all load-bearing choices
  mutation-proven (`tests/test_certify.c` + `tests/test_certify_teeth.c`).
- **independent oracle** `tools/diamond_oracle.wls` (wolframscript / Mathematica
  `SemidefiniteOptimization`, complex-native) confirms the MOSEK golden master to
  ≤1.1e-7. KEY: Mathematica SDP is **machine-precision only** (no `WorkingPrecision`)
  — certified high-precision η must come from the FLINT/arb route, not Mathematica.
- Design contract: `docs/cbnorm_tight_certifier.md` (TIB-grounded: Jansson SIAM
  2008, Watrous 1207.5726/TQI Ch.3, QETLAB). Follow-up `aic-ssu` (Julia end-to-end
  `certify(kraus)→(lo,hi)` wrapper). **Partial-trace direction in the dual is the
  load-bearing convention** (`aic_mat_partial_trace_right` / Convex sys 2, the
  MINOR/input factor) — pinned empirically by the asymmetric paper-example anchor;
  the design doc's first draft had it wrong.

## What this project is

Implement Alexei Kitaev, *Almost-idempotent quantum channels and approximate
$C^*$-algebras* ([arXiv:2405.02434](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02434)) as
**constructive finite-dimensional algorithms**. Architecture: tight C with two
numeric paths — **FLINT/arb** (certified arbitrary precision, the ground truth)
and **LAPACK double** (fast, uncertified) — later wrapped by a Julia `ccall`
package. The paper proves things non-constructively (Lefschetz–Hopf, Haar
diagonals, holomorphic calculus); our job is constructive finite-dim algorithms
whose outputs meet the paper's `O(ε)`/`O(η)` bound, which the arb path certifies.

## Read order (do this first)

1. `CLAUDE.md` — the contract: Laws 1–4 (ground-truth-by-citation; reuse FLINT/
   LAPACK; constructivize-don't-transcribe; **audition-don't-presume + the
   Pareto rule**), domain hallucination callouts, the paper structure map.
2. `MODULE_PLAN.md` — the module DAG, result→module map, build order.
3. `paper/shards/shard-*.md` — per-section analysis (statement+proof+
   constructivization). `paper/src/approximate_algebras.tex` is canonical ground
   truth (cite its line numbers in code).
4. `docs/adversarial/{README,nla,domain}.md` — the punishing-instance catalog
   (testing is adversarial-first; the happy path is a liability).

## How to build & test

```bash
make test     # 13 test binaries (mat/funcalc/contraction/harness/latd/smoke/
              #   ucp/idemp/ucp_d24/cbnorm/shim/certify/certify_teeth), all green
make lib      # build/libaic.so (shim symbols for the Julia ccall package)
              # zero warnings throughout (strict flags)
make bench    # ns/op microbenchmarks (double-vs-arb head-to-heads)
make fixtures # OPTIONAL: regenerate tests/fixtures_d24.inc.h via Julia+MOSEK
              #   (the committed .inc.h means `make test` does NOT need Julia)
make clean
```
Deps: gcc/C11, FLINT 3.0.1 (arb/acb bundled), LAPACK+LAPACKE+BLAS. `make` links
`-lflint -llapacke -llapack -lblas -lm`. For `make fixtures` only: Julia
(`~/.juliaup`) with the committed `julia/env` (Convex 0.16 + Mosek 11.2 +
MosekTools), MOSEK 11.1 at `~/mosek` + license `~/mosek/mosek.lic`. **No Python
anywhere** (user rule — Julia or C only; consumer Python bindings come later).

## What's built (all green, committed)

- **E0-infra epic — DONE.** `Makefile` (dual path), `include/aic.h`, the audition
  harness `tests/aic_test.h` (fail-loud `AIC_CHECK*`, `aic_acb_close`,
  `AIC_CHECK_DOUBLE_CLOSE`/`EIGSET_CLOSE` for double-vs-arb@53) and
  `bench/aic_bench.h` (`AIC_BENCH` → `BENCH … ns/op=…`).
- **`mat`** (`aic_mat_*`, arb substrate): Frobenius/operator norm, Hermitian eig
  (certified, **simple-spectrum only**), singular values, Kronecker, partial
  trace (left-major convention, matches tex:263–288). 14 cross-checks.
- **`funcalc`** (`aic_funcalc_*`): `sgn` (Newton–Schulz default + Denman–Beavers,
  **eig-free** so degeneracy-proof), `abs`, `theta`, `prop_P` (tex:524–533),
  `xpow`. 10 cross-checks incl. degenerate projector.
- **`contraction`** (`aic_contraction_*`): `lem_invfun` solver (tex:564–592),
  Picard + Anderson, callback-based, fail-loud guards. 30 cross-checks incl. the
  tex:594–599 sgn-system vs `aic_sgn` to 1e-25.
- **`latd`** (`aic_latd_*`, LAPACK double path): `LAPACKE_zheev` (Hermitian eig,
  **handles degenerate spectra**), `LAPACKE_zgesvd` (opnorm/SVD). 45 adversarial
  cross-checks; double-vs-arb@53 restored. 30×–370× faster than arb.
- **`ucp`** (`aic_ucp_*`, `aic-c7n`): UCP maps Φ:B(K)→B(H) as Kraus ops (Heisenberg
  `Φ(X)=ΣK_a†XK_a`); Kraus↔Choi (Convention A, `C=ΣE_ij⊗Φ(E_ij)`, K-major)↔
  Stinespring; CP cert via degeneracy-robust `herm_max_eig(−C)`; unital (two ways);
  carrier `Q=ΣK_aK_a†` + cor_carrier + PhiX_M; cb-norm CLOSED FORM `‖Φ(1)‖` (=1 UCP).
  373 checks. A hostile review caught a Choi-conjugation convention bug (now pinned
  by a `C[i,j]==Φ(E_ij)` oracle test). `‖Φ²−Φ‖_cb` is NOT here → `aic-d24` (SDP).
- **`idemp`** (`aic_idemp_*`, `aic-wuh`): `th_idemp_structure` for EXACT idempotent Φ
  (the η=0 oracle, tex:2055–2091). Double path extracts M=range(Q), A=ImgΦ (column-
  image SVD); arb path certifies the 5 relations (ΓC_MΔ=1_A, ΔΓC_M=Φ, w *-hom,
  block-diag, Γ-CP) machine-zero across 6 channels incl. M⊊H. 76 checks.
  **Milestone `aic-9kk` (η=0 vertical slice) ACHIEVED.**
- **`cbnorm`/η-defect** (`aic_ucp_compose`+`aic_ucp_choi_diff`, `aic-d24` increment 1):
  `‖Φ²−Φ‖_cb` (η). Λ=Φ²−Φ is NOT CP → needs the Watrous diamond-norm SDP. Route B:
  C core supplies `Choi(Φ²−Φ)` (both paths, cross-checked); the **SDP is in
  Julia+MOSEK** (`tools/gen_fixtures_d24.jl`, committed `julia/env`), NO Python.
  Load-bearing: `‖Λ‖_⋄ = (2/n)·SDP_optval` (Convention-A Choi has trace n). Golden
  master triple-verified (hand-derivation + Julia regen + independent CLARABEL)
  across n=2,3,4 + the paper's `η√(1−η)` example; 17 fixtures (incl. a complex one
  guarding Choi-conjugation, + a rank-deficient Λ); `test_ucp_d24` n=71. Certified-arb
  cb-ball + reusable value entry point → `aic-m24`.

## Key decisions & findings (the non-obvious stuff — don't relearn the hard way)

- **Two complementary paths, neither dominates (Pareto).** Double(LAPACK): fast,
  uncertified, **handles degeneracy**. Arb(FLINT): certified `O(ε)` balls,
  **simple-spectrum only**. Keep both, dispatch per regime.
- **FLINT's certified eig requires a SIMPLE spectrum** — it aborts on repeated
  eigenvalues. But this project is *dominated by degenerate spectra* (projections
  have eigenvalues 0/1 with multiplicity; target algebras are `⊕ B(L_j)`). So:
  - certified degenerate eig is an open P1 (`aic-w4o.1`, needs
    `acb_mat_eig_multiple_rump`/cluster enclosures);
  - meanwhile LAPACK `zheev` is the fast uncertified route for degenerate inputs;
  - **functional calculus is eig-free** (Newton–Schulz), so `sgn`/`abs`/`theta`/
    projection-extract sidestep the whole problem — prefer those routes.
- **Audition methodology (Law 4 + Pareto).** No algorithm is presumed fit; every
  choice is red-green TDD auditioned on correctness AND performance, candidates
  kept alive. When none dominates, add perf dimensions (wall time, iterations,
  memory, accuracy@prec, robustness) and keep the Pareto frontier.
- **Testing is adversarial-first.** Correct behavior on an evil input = the bound
  provably holds OR the routine fails loud — never plausible-but-wrong. The
  `mat` eig bench's well-separated spectrum is the *anti-pattern* (flatters the
  easy case). See `docs/adversarial/`.
- **The dimension-sweep is the universality canary** (`aic-dbo.3`): the paper's
  `O(ε)` constant is universal (dim-independent). A constant `∝ dim A` (e.g. from
  the naive Haar diagonal instead of the explicit B-diagonal, tex:484 vs
  tex:1249–1254) is invisible on any single instance — only a dim sweep catches
  it. This is the single highest-value correctness test.
- **η=0 oracle** is the zero-defect anchor: an exactly idempotent Φ must drive
  the whole pipeline to the exact Choi–Effros / `th_idemp_structure` structure
  with zero defect. Every evil sweep should reduce to it continuously as knob→0.
- **`factorize` and `cstar_build` are the most at-risk modules** (end-of-pipeline,
  outline proof, near-singular inversions, the composite constant).
- **The recurring failure mode is a test that *cannot fail*, not wrong math.**
  All three channel-module hostile reviews caught one: a Choi matrix that was the
  conjugate of the cited convention but passed every transpose-invariant check
  (`ucp`); a "Γ is CP" certificate that never read the stored Γ (`idemp`); a
  golden-master corpus of only real Kraus that could not catch a conjugation bug
  (`cbnorm`). **Always run a hostile review of a new core module, and demand each
  test be mutation-proven** (perturb the impl → RED → restore). The math is usually
  right; the test's *teeth* are what's missing.

## Channel-module conventions (ucp / idemp / cbnorm) — LOAD-BEARING, don't relearn

These pin the data model the headline path is built on. Verify against the `.tex`,
but start from here.

- **Heisenberg picture (observables), pinned.** A UCP map is `Φ: B(K)→B(H)`,
  `Φ(X)=Σ_a K_a† X K_a`, with `K_a: H→K` stored as a `dim_K × dim_H` `acb_mat`
  (`aic_ucp_kraus`). Unital ⇔ `Σ_a K_a†K_a = 1_H` (tex:1571). The state/Schrödinger
  dual is `T=Φ*`, `T(ρ)=Σ_a K_a ρ K_a†` — getting the dual backwards silently
  transposes everything (CLAUDE.md callout).
- **Choi Convention A (the bug that bit).** `C_Φ = Σ_ij E_ij ⊗ Φ(E_ij)`, K-factor
  MAJOR/LEFT: `C[i*dim_H+a, j*dim_H+b] = Φ(E_ij)[a,b] = Σ_x conj(K_x[i,a])·K_x[j,b]`
  — **the conjugation is on the FIRST (i,a) factor.** The first ucp impl conjugated
  the second factor (building `conj(C_Φ)=C_Φᵀ`); it passed unital/CP/round-trip
  (all transpose-invariant) and was caught only by the oracle test asserting a Choi
  block equals `aic_ucp_apply(Φ, E_ij)`. That oracle + a complex-Kraus fixture now
  guard it. Unital check via `aic_mat_partial_trace_left` (traces out the LEFT/K
  factor → keeps H).
- **Carrier `M = range(Q)`, `Q = Σ_a K_a K_a† = Φ*(1)`** (lem_carrier tex:1724).
  `M ⊊ H ⇔ Φ is NOT trace-preserving` (i.e. `Q≠I`). Do NOT assume `M=H` (a web
  source wrongly claimed "carrier=H for UCP" — it confused `Φ(I)=I` with the
  carrier). The certified rank of `Q` is gap-dependent → `aic-w4o.1`.
- **`idemp` (th_idemp_structure, the η=0 oracle).** `A = ImgΦ` is built by the
  **column-image SVD** (apply `Φ` to all `E_ij`, SVD the stacked outputs) — NOT the
  `n²×n²` superoperator matrix (that route risks a vec-convention bug; the
  column-image route reuses the tested `aic_ucp_apply`). `Γ` is built via the
  **`Λ=ΔΓ` factorization** (`Λ(Y)=Φ(J_M Y J_M†)`, `Γ=Δ†Λ` since `Δ` has orthonormal
  columns), NOT a `w`-pseudoinverse — this `Γ` is UCP by construction (tex:2088).
  `A`'s basis has a **unitary gauge freedom** → cross-check `A` as a SUBSPACE
  (`Π_A=ΔΔ†`), never operator-by-operator.
- **cb-norm / η-defect (Route B, no Python).** `η = ‖Φ²−Φ‖_cb`; `Λ=Φ²−Φ` is
  Hermiticity-preserving but **NOT CP**, so the CP closed form `‖Φ‖_cb=‖Φ(1)‖`
  does NOT apply — a **Watrous diamond-norm SDP** is required (tex:352). Split: the
  **C core** computes `Choi(Φ²−Φ)` (`aic_ucp_compose` gives `Φ²` Kraus `{K_bK_a}`;
  `aic_ucp_choi_diff`); the **SDP lives in Julia+MOSEK** (`tools/gen_fixtures_d24.jl`).
  **Load-bearing normalization: `‖Λ‖_⋄ = (2/n)·SDP_optval`** because Convention-A
  Choi has trace `n` (the Watrous SDP is trace-1 calibrated) — verified across
  n=2,3,4 (the dimension canary pins it). Analytic anchors for tests:
  `‖Dep_d−id_d‖_⋄ = 2(1−1/d²)`; `Φ_t=(1−t)id+t·Dep ⇒ ‖Φ_t²−Φ_t‖_⋄ = t(1−t)·2(1−1/d²)`;
  the paper's own example (tex:367) `‖Φ²−Φ‖_cb = η√(1−η)`.
- **The certified-arb degenerate-eig wall (`aic-w4o.1`) is the recurring deferral.**
  FLINT's certified eig (`acb_mat_eig_simple`) needs a SIMPLE spectrum; the project's
  spectra are degenerate (projections 0/1, `⊕B(L_j)`). So the *certified* halves of
  Kraus-extraction (`ucp`), `M`/`A`-subspace extraction (`idemp`), and `projection`
  all use the LAPACK double path now and defer certification to `aic-w4o.1`
  (tooling: `acb_mat_eig_multiple_rump`, `acb_mat_eig_global_enclosure`, or an
  eig-free Cholesky route). The *checks* that avoid full eig (PSD via
  `herm_max_eig(−C)`, relation defects) are already certified.

## What's next (ready work — `bd ready`)

Issue tracker is **beads**, prefix `aic` (persistent across sessions; JSONL at
`.beads/issues.jsonl` is committed). `bd ready` for the live list. **This session
BUILT `aic-knm` (`ecstar`) Cycles 1+2** (data model + basis-sweep estimators +
HOPM worst-case search, committed) and filed `aic-b7c`/`aic-3qq`/`aic-cr6`/
`aic-0at`/`aic-4c7`. Prior session CLOSED `aic-m24`/`aic-cne`; earlier
`aic-c7n`/`aic-wuh`/`aic-9kk`/`aic-d24`.

- **`aic-b7c` (P1) — RUN FIRST.** The deferred Cycle-2 hostile review (interrupted
  by the outage); its bead description is the full review brief. Blocks `aic-knm`
  closure. Fix any findings, then `bd close aic-knm`.
- **`aic-knm` (P2, in_progress)** — `ecstar`: Cycles 1+2 committed & green; remaining
  to close = `aic-b7c` (review) passes. Cycle 3 (certified SDP UPPER bound) is the
  separate `aic-0at`. See the playbook below.
- **`aic-92f`** (`assoc_ecsa`, almost-idempotent ε-C* via Φ̃=θ(2Φ−1)) — **the next
  headline step**, unblocked by `aic-knm`'s deliverables. Builds A=ImgΦ̃ (θ on the
  superoperator 2Φ−1, reuse `funcalc`), feeds the `ecstar` estimators, and finally
  exercises the Π_A teeth (`aic-3qq`) + the real O(η) canary (`aic-4c7`). η
  measurable/certifiable now (Julia+MOSEK + the arb certifier).
- **`aic-ssu` (P2, NEW)** — Julia end-to-end `certify(kraus)→(lo,hi)` wrapper:
  solve MAX primal + MIN dual (already in `src/sdp.jl`), ccall `aic_cbnorm_certify_d`,
  return the rigorous bracket; test vs the wolframscript oracle on live channels.
- **`aic-w4o.1` (P1)** — certified degenerate Hermitian eig (arb). The main
  certified-path debt: gates the certified extraction deferred in `ucp` (Kraus),
  `idemp` (M, A subspaces), and `projection`. Tooling: `acb_mat_eig_multiple_rump`
  (cluster enclosures), `acb_mat_eig_global_enclosure`; audition vs an eig-free
  Cholesky route (bead notes).
- **`aic-m24` (P2, NEW)** — certified-arb cb-ball (KKT/rational-certificate; no arb
  SDP solver — research escalation) + reusable diamond-norm value entry point (E5).
- Rest of **E2-eps** (`aic-vs9`): `unitfix`, `unitary`, `projection` (blocked by
  `aic-w4o.1`), `corner`. Then **E3-mainthm**, **E4-headline**, **E5-julia**,
  **E6-research** (`aic-1bc` c_0, `aic-1sk` factorization closure).
- **`aic-dbo.2` (P1)** — adversarial instance generators (evil-matrix corpus; unify
  with `aic-f9u.1`).
- **NEW follow-ups from this session:** `aic-ynu` (P2, Artin–Wedderburn block
  decomposition + prop_Gamma explicit form + Δ/Γ Kraus reps); `aic-kyj` (P3, idemp
  test teeth: single-split block-diag channel + genuine double-vs-arb subspace
  oracle when `aic-w4o.1` lands).
- Housekeeping: `aic-w4o.4` (split oversized test files — `test_mat/funcalc/
  contraction/latd/idemp` and `test_idemp.h` (208 LOC) all > 200 LOC); `aic-w4o.2`
  (full arb SVD); `aic-w4o.3` (opnorm power-iteration audition); `aic-f9u.1`
  (shared corpus); `aic-f9u.2` (multi-dim Pareto bench reporting).

## Next-step playbook — `aic-knm` (`ecstar`), the chosen next module

Goal: the **ε-$C^*$ algebra data model + axiom-defect estimators** (shard A; defs
at `tex:403–492`, the approximate axioms at `tex:407–439`). This is the last
blocker for `aic-92f` (`assoc_ecsa`), so it is the direct route to the headline.

- **Research first** (the discipline): one paper-leg (Sonnet) on shard A + `tex:403–492`
  — the exact ε-$C^*$ axioms (associativity, `‖XY‖≤(1+ε)‖X‖‖Y‖`, the $C^*$ identity,
  unit laws — ALL only up to ε), the δ-homomorphism defs (`tex:443–455`; keep ε vs δ
  distinct), and what an "axiom-defect estimator" must compute; plus one web-leg
  (best-in-class: estimating the associativity/multiplicativity defect of a finite-dim
  near-algebra — operator norm of the associator trilinear map; how to take the sup
  over the unit ball — basis sweep vs power iteration). Decide the route, then implement.
- **Data model.** An ε-$C^*$ algebra here is a subspace `A ⊆ M_N` with the
  **Choi–Effros star** `X⋆Y = Φ(XY)` (NOT plain `XY`; the product leaves `ImgΦ`),
  involution `X↦X†`, norm inherited from `M_N`. For the exact case `A = ImgΦ`
  (reuse `aic_idemp`); for the almost-idempotent case (built by `assoc_ecsa`)
  `A = ImgΦ̃`, `Φ̃ = θ(2Φ−1)` (reuse `funcalc` θ on the **superoperator** `2Φ−1`).
  Store `A` as its orthonormal operator basis (the `aic_idemp` `A_basis` shape).
- **Defect estimators** (return certified arb balls): associativity
  `‖(X⋆Y)⋆Z − X⋆(Y⋆Z)‖` over the unit ball; submultiplicativity slack
  `sup ‖X⋆Y‖−(1+ε)‖X‖‖Y‖`; $C^*$-identity `‖X⋆X†‖` vs `‖X‖²`; unit-law defect
  (the exact unit only exists after `prop_unit`, `tex:672` — `unitfix`, a sibling
  bead). Each star multiplication goes through `aic_ucp_apply`.
- **η=0 oracle** (mandatory): for an EXACT idempotent Φ, `A=ImgΦ` is a genuine
  $C^*$ algebra → all defects must be **machine-zero**. Reuse the six `test_idemp`
  channels. Then an ε-sweep (perturb toward almost-idempotent) must show every
  defect growing `= O(ε)`, and the **dimension sweep** must show the constant does
  NOT grow with `dim A` (the universality canary, `aic-dbo.3`).
- **Reuse** `aic_ucp` (the star), `aic_mat` (`opnorm`/`herm_max_eig`), `aic_idemp`
  (the exact-case `A`). η is measurable via the `aic-d24` Julia+MOSEK golden master.
- `bd show aic-knm` for the bead; then `bd update aic-knm --claim`.

## Orchestration mode (how this was run, to continue it)

The user runs this as a serial orchestration: the orchestrator stays in the loop,
delegates each step to a **subagent** (Opus for coding/hostile-review, Sonnet for
research/summarization), and **independently verifies** (don't trust a subagent
report — re-run `make clean && make test`, read the diff, check zero warnings).
The per-module pipeline used this session, which works:

1. **Research (parallel OK)** — for every core module, a paper-constructivization
   leg (shard + `.tex`) **and** a web-leg surveying best-in-class published
   algorithms/impls. *Web-research EVERY algorithm* (user directive) — cb-norm,
   fixed-point structure, etc. **Research may run in parallel; Julia may NOT.**
2. **Decide the route** (orchestrator), recording the audition slate (Law 4).
3. **Implement** (Opus subagent), tests-first TDD, both number paths, ≤200 LOC/file.
4. **Independent build-verify** (orchestrator).
5. **Hostile review** (Opus subagent) — ALWAYS for a core module; it has caught a
   real defect every single time (see the "tests that can't fail" note above).
6. **Fix pass** (Opus), mutation-proving the new teeth.
7. **Commit atomically** per closed bead with `.tex`-line provenance; file beads
   for every deferral as it arises.

Standing directives (also in the harness memory dir): **No Python in the codebase**
— Julia or C only (consumer Python bindings come later). **Golden masters** are
encouraged as an independent cross-check rung — MOSEK/Gurobi (local) for SDPs,
Mathematica/`wolframscript` (needs the user's VPN) for exact fun-calc, driven from
Julia or C. **No parallel Julia** (precompile/env fragility — one Julia process at
a time). `TaskCreate` is fine for ephemeral in-session tracking; **beads is the
only persistent tracker** (`bd ready`/`bd show`; export to `.beads/issues.jsonl`
before committing — the pre-commit hook also syncs it). **No GitHub CI.** A git
**remote now exists** (`origin`, GitHub; user directive 2026-05-30) — **push after
every commit** (`git pull --rebase && git push`). The `.beads/issues.jsonl` in git
is the bead persistence; no `bd dolt` remote is configured (`bd dolt push` is N/A).

## Conventions / gotchas

- Cite `approximate_algebras.tex:<line>` + the verbatim equation in every math
  routine (Law 1). `≤200 LOC` per **source** file (several test files exceed it →
  `aic-w4o.4`). Arb-path `.c` files never *call* LAPACK (the link line bundles both
  for tests; the rule is about which library each routine calls). Fail-loud on
  precondition violation / LAPACK `info!=0` / lost precision / an arb ball that
  straddles a decision boundary (e.g. PSD: `herm_max_eig(−C)` ball straddling 0).
- `acb_mat_eig_simple` needs a SIMPLE spectrum; `LAPACKE_zheev` does not. Vec/Choi
  is **row-major** (`vec(X)[a*n+b]=X[a,b]`; Choi K-major); `latd` conversions are
  row-major. The Choi conjugation is on the FIRST factor (see Channel-module
  conventions — this is the bug that bit).
- `tests/fixtures_d24.inc.h` is **generated but committed** (so `make test` needs
  no Julia); regenerate with `make fixtures` after touching the SDP/corpus, and the
  Makefile makes `tests/*.inc.h` a test prerequisite so a stale fixture forces a
  rebuild. Julia work is **serial** (no parallel Julia). **No Python.**
- Before committing, `bd export > .beads/issues.jsonl` so the bead state lands with
  the commit (the pre-commit hook in `core.hooksPath=.beads/hooks` also syncs it).
  Close beads with a detailed `--reason`; force-close (`--force`) only when a
  deliverable ships but a DAG dep is a deferred remainder (tracked elsewhere) — as
  `aic-wuh` was (its certified-extraction half is on `aic-w4o.1`).
